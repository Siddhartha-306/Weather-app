# Weather App

## Overview

Welcome to the Weather App repository! This web application provides real-time weather information based on user input.
The app is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple and intuitive user interface for checking the weather conditions.

## Features

- **Current Weather:** Get the current weather conditions for a specific location.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/Siddhartha-306/Weather-app.git

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

3. Enter the name of the city or location you want to check the weather for in the provided input field.

4. Click the "Get Weather" button to retrieve and display the current weather and forecast.

## Dependencies

The Weather App relies on the following technologies:

- **HTML:** Provides the structure of the web page.
- **CSS:** Styles the user interface and ensures a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript:** Fetches weather data from a third-party API and dynamically updates the content on the page.

## API Integration

This app utilizes a third-party weather API to retrieve real-time weather information.
You will need to sign up for an API key from the provider and replace the placeholder in the JavaScript code with your actual API key.

// Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key
    const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
